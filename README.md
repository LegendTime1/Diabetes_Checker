# AnalyzeBloodwork
Single and multiple regressions, and scatterplots for clinical bloodwork and gene expression data.

([AnalyzeBloodwork.R](../master/AnalyzeBloodwork.R)) will allow you to load a comma-delimited .csv with various datapoints, perform single and multiple regressions of Body Mass Index (BMI) vs. variables from the Complete Blood Count with Differential (CBC-D) results, and produce 2-D and 3-D scatterplots for the results.
